I developed a game server for a mobile game company.
so I have developed/troubleshooting capabilities throughout the entire life cycle of 3 or 4 games from the beginning of the project to launch and live update. 
I developed a system that can detect in-game abusers through user clustering using machine learning techniques and a QA multilingual task automation system using optical character recognition (ocr). Recently, I am developing a voice recognition server platform at Hyundai Motor Company. I follow the Boy Scouts rule of "always leave the campsite cleaner than when I first came".
