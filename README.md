I developed a game server for a mobile game company.
so I have developed/troubleshooting capabilities throughout the entire life cycle of 3 or 4 games from the beginning of the project to launch and live update. 
I developed a system that can detect in-game abusers through user clustering using machine learning techniques. 
Recently, I am developing a QA multilingual  automation system using optical character recognition (ocr). 
I follow the Boy Scouts rule of "always leave the campsite cleaner than when I first came".
